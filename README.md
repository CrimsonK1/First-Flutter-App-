Food App developed on flutter

To run this app you'll need VSC, with flutter extensions and SDK installed, as well as Android Studio to emulate a mobile device.
Every important .dart file is located in the 'lib' folder, and all the used images and icons are in the 'assets' folder.

The pubspec.yaml has the declarations and dependencies needed to run the app.
